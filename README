This package contains code to generate and verify the RLWE challenges. It also contains one of the protobuf files needed to read the serialized challenges. The proto file can be used with any language with an implementation of protocol-buffers.

The library only contains files generated by hprotoc; the executable contains the code to generate, suppress, and verify challenges.
